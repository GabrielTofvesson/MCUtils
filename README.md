# Minecraft Utils

A fun little collection of code for making Minecaft modding easier.

## What? Why?

This project was created because it got annoying to have to reinvent the wheel
with so many things common in Minecaft modding. With this in mind, the library
is constantly evolving; including support for systems such as networking,
multiblock structures and automatic block and item creation, instantiation and
registration. The goal of this mod is to make life easier for the modder.
